You are the brave knight Sir Oliver, thrown out of his kingdom for a crime he didn’t commit. It’s your job to escape the ancient prison infested with foul bug monsters and save the kingdom that abandoned you.


Movement:
* Left (A) and Right (D).
* Jumping (W): Once you upgrade your jump, you have the ability to double jump, by pressing w while in the air, and you unlock more jumps by collecting feathers across the map.
* Gliding (W while in the air and out of jumps): Slows your ascent while in the air. Used for traversing large gaps.


Enemies:
* Worms: Worms will run from the player, and touching them will restore your health slightly.
* Ants: Ants will travel in a straight line, but they can be either avoided or defeated fairly easily.
* Spiders: Spiders will drop down from the ceiling and move towards the player when you get close.
* Beetles: Beetles work like ants, but move slower and will chase after you if you get near.
* Grasshoppers: Grasshoppers move like ants, but jump up and down around the place.
* Wasps: Wasps float aimlessly in one spot, but will notice you if you get to close. They will begin to chase you, only stopping if they’re dead or you’re far out of range.
* Golden Worms: Have a chance to spawn in rooms. Catching it will give you the ability to eat enemies and restore half health.
* Beetle King: The final boss. It will climb up and down the wall, shooting projectiles at you. Take cover from branches or destroy them with attacks, and whittle down the bos’ health to win the game.


Areas:
* Tutorial: This linear section acts as an introduction to the game, starting with abilities you won’t have when the game begins.
* The main two rooms act as a sort of hub area between the other areas. To the left is an area with lots of spiders, and the right has many wasps. As you progress in those two areas, they connect to each other.
* Collecting feathers from these areas will grant access to the exit of the Spiral Root, which leads upwards to the area with the final boss.


NPCs (interact by pressing Enter):
* Egg Bird: A bird who wants you to collect five eggs around the map. One will appear back at the start of the game, one will appear to the top right of the room he is in, one will appear in the Spider’s Den, one will appear in the Wasps’ Nest, and one in the area before exiting the Spiral Root. For each egg, he will give either an upgrade to your speed or health. He can also give you the cloaking ability.
* Birdsong NPCs will give you the birdsong abilities if you talk to them. Other NPCs may give hints.


Sword (J): Your sword floats behind you automatically, but you can attack reliably and quickly with J. Afterwards, it will return to its passive position. 


Spells:
* Ice Lance: A simple projectile that travels in a straight line a short distance. Destroys itself upon making contact with an enemy. Unlocked at start.
* Thundercaw: (L+S) A wave that damages all enemies in a short range around the player. Takes much longer to charge than Ice Lance. Unlocked in the Wasp Nest.
* Windblade: (L+W) A projectile that travels in a short crescent downward in front of the player. Can deal a lot of damage quickly, but takes a while to charge. Unlocked in Spider’s Den.
* Phoenix Burst: (L+D or A): A large projectile that cleaves through enemies for a distance and deals a significant amount of damage. Takes a long time to charge. Unlocked in the upper areas of the starting room.


Eating (H): The player can also eat downed enemies to regain their health after collecting a golden worm.

Cloaking (Shift): Holding down Shift with this ability unlocked will hide you from being noticed by spiders or bees if you haven’t alerted them yet. It can only be used for a few seconds and has a cooldown.

R can be pressed to restart the room (use if stuck).
